# JupyterLab Terminal

When launching a JupyterLab session, the first thing you will see in the terminal are some log messages and a URL as in the image below:

From those log messages, the most important one is the URL (highlighted in the red box in the image above ⬆️). Usually, when launching the JupyterLab session, it will automatically open on the browser, but if that is not the case or you closed your window and want to open it again this URL is your solution. By copying and pasting this URL into your web browser, you will be able to access JupyterLab.

It usually looks like `http://localhost:8888/lab?token=...`, where `localhost` refers to your own computer, `8888` is the port number, and `token=...` is a unique token that allows you to access JupyterLab without needing to log in.
