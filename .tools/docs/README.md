**LabConstrictor** turns your Jupyter notebooks into **installable desktop applications**. This lets users launch your work right away, without needing to use Python, pip, or any terminal commands.

This GitHub template handles everything for you. It packages your notebooks, builds installers for different platforms, and provides a simple, user-friendly **Welcome dashboard**. Your users can open your app with a double-click, while you keep a versioned, reproducible workflow.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

LabConstrictor is ideal for:
- Researchers sharing reproducible analysis pipelines or lab tools.
- Developers shipping interactive notebooks to non-technical users.
- Educators running workshops where setup time must be near zero.


## ✨ LabConstrictor's Features 

* **Easy Configuration**: Includes a web form to easily configure repo settings, manage dependencies, and brand your application without manual editing.
* **Cross-Platform**: Automatically builds `.exe` (Windows), `.pkg` (macOS), and `.sh` (Linux) installers.
* **Auto-Hide Code**: Code cells can be hidden, allowing users to see a clean, "app-like" interface, but still being able to reveal code if needed.
* **Dependency Guardrails**: automatic workflows merge and validate requirements, catching conflicts *before* you release.
* **Version Control**: Helper cells track versions and alert users when an update is available.
