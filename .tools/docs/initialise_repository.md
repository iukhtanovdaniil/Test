# Initialising your repository

Now that your repository is set up, you can start to customise it (bellow you can find a GIF with the whole process). To get started, you will need:

- A name for your project/application (e.g., `CellAnalyzer`).
- An initial version number (e.g., `0.1.0`).
- (Optionally) Images for App installer customisation. See [Installer Images Customisation](installer_images.md) for more details on the images you can provide.

Once you have everything ready, go to [https://labconstrictor-form.streamlit.app/](https://labconstrictor-form.streamlit.app/). If you see a `Zzzz` message for inactivity, click `Yes, get this app back up!`. Next, select `Start initialisation` in the **Initialise a repository** section. Follow the instructions on the website. After you submit the form, a Pull Request with suggested changes will be created in your repository. To learn how to accept these suggestions, see [How to accept a Pull Request](accept_pull_request.md). After you accept the suggestions, the main README will move to [.tools/docs](.). But don't be afraid, the new README will have a link pointing the instructions for future reference, so you won’t lose access to them.
