# Usage of Notebooks After Installation

After you install the desktop application, this guide will show you how to use the Jupyter notebooks that come with it.

## 1. Launching the Application

To open the application, go to the Start Menu on Windows or Linux, or the Applications folder on macOS. Search for the application name and click its icon to start it.

## 2. Welcome Notebook

When you start the application, Jupyter Lab will open in your default web browser. The welcome notebook will appear automatically:

![Welcome Notebook](https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/LabConstrictor/blob/doc_source/Welcome_Notebook.png)

## 3. How to Run Notebooks?

You might be used to work with notebooks on JupyterLab (in case you need so guidance on JupyterLab check [this guide](jupyterlab_guide/jupyterlab_guide.md)). Still, LabConstrisctor uses some features that can slightly change how you interact with notebooks. Please check [this guide](code_hiding.md) to understand how to run notebooks packaged with LabConstrictor.

## 4. Accessing your Notebooks

Once you run the welcome notebook, a dashboard will show a list of available notebooks. It looks similar to the screenshot in the [Welcome Notebook](#welcome-notebook) step.

In the last column of the dashboard, you'll see a button called `Open the Notebook`. Click it to open that notebook in a new tab and run it just like you did with the welcome notebook.
